# Advance House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features and characteristics of the properties.

## Problem Statement

The goal of the Advance House Price Prediction project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices using historical property data. This information is crucial for real estate agents, buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions in the housing market.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on various features of properties, including but not limited to:

- `MSSubClass`: Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale.
- `MSZoning`: Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale.
- `LotFrontage`: Linear feet of street connected to the property.
- `LotArea`: Lot size in square feet.
- `Street`: Type of road access to the property.
- `Alley`: Type of alley access to the property.
- `LotShape`: General shape of the property.
- `LandContour`: Flatness of the property.
- `Utilities`: Type of utilities available.
- `LotConfig`: Lot configuration.
- `LandSlope`: Slope of the property.
- ... (other feature columns)

## Architecture of the Project

The project will be structured in the following steps:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Data Cleaning
- Missing Values Handling
- Outlier Detection and Treatment
- Feature Engineering

### 2. Feature Selection and Model Training

- Feature Score Calculation
- Train Multiple Models
- Select Best Model for House Price Prediction

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset containing property features and corresponding house prices in the desired format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
2. Execute the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) script to perform data preprocessing steps and feature engineering.
3. Save the modified dataset for feature selection and model training.
4. Execute the Feature Selection and Model Training script to calculate feature scores, train multiple models, and select the best model for house price prediction.
5. Utilize the trained model to make price predictions for new properties.
